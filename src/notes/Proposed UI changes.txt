Notes on proposed UI changes

1. UI Toolkit - basic non styled ui elements as a library
- Fitted to breakpoints by media queries
=> Use Typescript and create a library of simple UI Elements like IFG bootstrap

2. UI Theme - Site specific theme to make UI toolkit look like Surfdome, Blackleaf ...
- Specific colours and layouts
=> Use UI toolkit and create required templates and layouts with style

3. Components - Small collections of UI elements that perform a behaviour
- Poscode lookup
- Search box
- Delivery address
- Billing address
=> Specific implementations that will be used

4. Behaviours - Well described pieces of bussiness logic parts of the sales funnel
- Use checkout to Buy socks
- Update delivery Address of order 
=> These should be a match with the acceptance criteria and used to test both end to end and units

5. Modules - Block of UI elements with some behaviour so that the site can transition funnel activities 
- Checkout
- Basket
- PDP 
- Search
=> Full working pieces of implemented react code with connections to the existing Equillibrium for data to be replaced with services later

6. Funnel - a collection of behaviours that produce a customers outcome 
- From entry of customer to site to purchase of socks including payment
=> These are ways the site and it's modules are used chains of behaviours and modules and could also be micro sites

7. A Site - a collection of modules that have a theme and all required behaviours to be useful to the customer
- Surfdome
- Blackleaf
=> Will become a recreation of the full sites with all functionality replaced and utilising all other layers
